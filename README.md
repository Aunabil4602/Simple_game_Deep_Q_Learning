# Simple_game_Deep_Q_Learning
This is my first Q Learning project using Neural Network on a simple game. The AI will try to dodge the obstacles by moving either left or right. It took 100 gernerations to reach this stage. 

It got 3 inputs states and 2 action states. The inner layer consists of one layer having 8 neurons followed by the output layer. The reward for crossing each obstacle is +1 and -1 for failure.
